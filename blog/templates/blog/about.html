    <h3>About</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Working a 9-5 is soul sucking. I also don't want to rely on a job as my single source of income. The company can fire you at anytime. That's why I want to create assets that could generate a side income for me. I don't know where this will take me, but I am documenting my progress in this blog.</p>
